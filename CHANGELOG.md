# Changelog

All notable changes to MyGo Music are written down here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A plugin can export `fallbackStream` to play a song another source couldn't, with the track's metadata rather than its own ID.
- The app asks every enabled plugin with `fallbackStream` in turn when a source can't play a song or fetch its audio, skipping the source that failed.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- The Shuffle button in a list now lets any song come first, instead of always keeping the first one first. A song you pick to start still stays first.
- Seeking in AAC audio in an MP4, including a fragmented file as streaming sites serve it, lands on the same frame as playing straight through, not a second or so off after the first short packet.
- The end of a fragmented MP4 no longer plays the silence padding of its last packet.
- Now Playing's lyrics start at the top in a tall window, instead of leaving the top of the window empty and cutting off the lines before the one sung.
- Japanese lyrics are drawn in a Japanese font, kanji and kana alike, rather than their kanji in the font of the app's language.
- On English Windows, Chinese text is drawn in one Chinese font, not with characters in different fonts.
- A plugin that needs setting up says why, in its settings and in the player, instead of "Fill these in for it to work" whatever it said. The message goes away once the program is allowed or the setting is saved.
- A plugin's `id` and `main` must now stay inside the plugin's folder, so a plugin dropped into the plugins folder can't read another plugin's saved settings or run code from outside its folder.
- The notch's Shuffle and Repeat buttons take the accent colour.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Audio in MP4s cut into fragments, as streaming sites serve it, plays as it comes in, and so does FLAC in MP4. A plugin for such a site can give the app the stream's address as it is, without converting it first.

### Fixed

- With Grow From the Cover on, Now Playing no longer takes hundreds of megabytes more memory each time it opens out of the cover, as it did on Windows.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- A plugin's picture URLs can say where the size goes with `{size}`, such as `?param={size}y{size}`, and the app fetches each cover the size it shows, so rows of covers take much less memory and come in faster.
- Settings > Experiments has Grow From the Cover, for Now Playing to open out of the player bar's cover as before.

### Changed

- Now Playing slides up from the bottom of the window as it opens, and back down as it closes.

### Fixed

- A plugin's page that changes as you play, such as songs played lately, shows what's new when you open it again a while later, without restarting the app.
- Big covers that come only large are decoded within a memory budget, and the app gives memory back once they're shown and when the window hides.
- A plugin that reads its storage or settings at its top level no longer hangs as it starts.
- The button that saves a playlist's new name reads 保存 in Chinese, not 收藏.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Plugins can list `requestHeaders` in plugin.json: headers, such as a session's cookie, that the app sends with the plugin's pictures and audio, so covers kept behind a sign-in, as fnOS Music's are, show.

### Fixed

- Headers a plugin gives for a stream no longer go on to another host the stream redirects to.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- ALAC, AAC and WAV files play, from local folders and from plugins. WAV and ALAC show the Lossless badge.

### Fixed

- Big covers take much less memory to show as small thumbnails, and a cover shown at several sizes at once is fetched and decoded only once.
- Long audio, such as a ten-hour audiobook, no longer takes a lot of memory for its spectrum, and streams that don't say how long they are get levels all the way through.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Plugins can head the page of a feature card's songs, such as a daily mix, with their own title and subtitle, and the page is headed as the card is.
- Plugins can mark a playlist of yours as fixed, such as a service's liked songs. It stays under My Playlists but can't be renamed, deleted or changed.

### Fixed

- Playlists and Liked Songs changed in the service's own apps or website now show those changes, without restarting the app.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- On macOS, the app no longer takes more and more memory while something on screen moves, such as the lyrics in Now Playing.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- A podcast's host, on its page, opens the host's own page, for plugins that have one.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Plugins can give you a page of your own, such as your profile, which opens from My Page in the account menu.
- Plugin pages can be headed with a round picture and a description, as an artist's page is, and their sections can say when they're empty.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- On Windows, programs a plugin starts no longer open a console window.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- On Linux, signing in to a plugin that shows its service's sign-in page no longer closes the whole app.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-11-07

### Changed

- Checking plugins for updates uses your GitHub token, from `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` or `gh auth token`, so frequent checks no longer run into GitHub's limit. Plugins from private repositories can be installed and updated with it too.
- Updating a plugin installs the version its check found, rather than asking GitHub again.

### Fixed

- On Windows and Linux, the + in Settings > Plugins no longer sits under the window's close button.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed

- Chinese titles, artists, albums and lyrics in older MP3 tags, written as GBK, no longer show as garbled Latin letters, and ID3v1 tags with accents or Chinese are no longer left blank. Your library is read again once to pick this up.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Check a plugin for updates whenever you like, from its ⋯ menu in Settings > Plugins, instead of waiting for the daily check. Its row says whether it's up to date.
- A plugin's repository in Settings > Plugins is a link to it on GitHub.

### Changed

- The warning about a plugin starting programs is no longer shown in red.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- A plugin can say the oldest version of MyGo Music it works with, as `minAppVersion` in `plugin.json`. An older app won't install it, and says to update first.
- Plugins can be translated: the app shows a plugin's name, settings and sidebar in your language from its `locales/zh-CN.json`, and plugins can translate their pages with `host.t` and `host.language`. Changing the language reloads the plugin's page in it.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-11-06

### Changed

- A plugin's `process` permission can list the programs it may start, such as `["bin/helper-*", "ffmpeg"]`, and it can't start any other, even once you've allowed it. Installing or allowing such a plugin names those programs. `true` still means any program.
- Updating a plugin asks again when the new version wants to start a program the old one didn't.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed

- Signing in from Settings opens the sign-in dialog, and a plugin's sign-in page, over the Settings window instead of behind it, over the main window.
- Settings no longer offers Sign In for a plugin you haven't switched to yet that's already signed in.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Install plugins from a `mygo-music://install-plugin?repo=owner/repo` link. It opens Settings > Plugins and asks before anything is installed.
- Settings > Plugins has a + menu to install from GitHub, a folder or a zip, or to show the plugins folder. Each plugin's ⋯ menu shows its folder or removes the plugin, which moves it to the Trash after asking.
- Songs with no cover, or whose cover failed to load, show a note cover in Now Playing.

### Changed

- Installing from GitHub takes any GitHub page address or `git@` address, not just the repository's root.
- A plugin's update error shows next to that plugin.
- Primary buttons and settings use the app's accent colour.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- The next song is fetched ahead of time, so it starts right away when its turn comes.
- You can seek in a song that's still downloading. Seeking past what has arrived shows that the song is loading instead of going quiet.
- Plugins can sign in on a web page the app shows (`host.webSignIn`), for services whose website is the only way in.
- Install plugins from a folder or a zip on this computer.

### Fixed

- A sign-in that fails straight away no longer makes the dialog flash and jump.
- The daily card's section keeps a gap above the cards below it.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-11-06

### Fixed

- The daily card's grooves ripple more slowly, so the GPU stays mostly idle on Home while its songs play.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- Now Playing grows out of the player bar's cover, and you can pull it down to close it. With reduced motion turned on, it fades in place.
- The search field has a clear button, and its recent searches popup matches the macOS search menu.

### Fixed

- The window no longer shakes while it's dragged.
- Clicks anywhere on the search field reach it, including the icon and the edges.
- Now Playing's bars fade as it closes instead of showing over the player bar.
- The wall's cover stays in place as it flies out of the player bar.
- The sidebar's dropdowns open and close at once.

### Changed

- The hairline between the sidebar and the page is gone.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- A website with English and Chinese download pages.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-06

The first release: a native music player that plays your local files and gets everything else from plugins.
